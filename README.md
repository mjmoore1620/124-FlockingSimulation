# 124-FlockingSimulation
Flocking simulation based on Coding Train demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhjuuHl6qHM

# Progress
* Started: 5/9/2020
* Basic functionality: 5/11/2020

# What is the purpose of this exercise?
* To explore emergent behavior: flocking, using several simple rules for each boid

# What should I get out of doing this exercise?
* Learn about a particular way to model group behavior spatially
* Improve my ability to use vectors

# What I have got from doing this so far?
* I understand vectors a little better
* I refreshed my skills with p5.js, javascript
* I got to see dude use a constructor in javascript finally

# Specifications
* Boids (entities) should exhibit a flocking behavior with only 3 concepts: alignment, cohesion, separation

# Possible Modifications
* Optimize using spatial db
* add user controlled entity
* add predator type of boid to remove boids
* add food entity and expiration timer to boids
